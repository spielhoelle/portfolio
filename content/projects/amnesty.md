The design of the „Themenkoordinationsgruppe Polizei und Menschenrechte“ of Amnesty International is based on their global side, but the architecture and the micro-design is unique. The site itself is very busy, it publishes several times a week new content and records every day hundreds of hits. Its wordpress-based, bilingual and a specially created mailchimp-newsletter-API connection is the cherry on the cake on this project.
